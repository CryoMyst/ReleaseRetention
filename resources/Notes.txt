Requirement notes:

    Be a reusable and testable component:
        Class Library 
    Take the number of releases to keep as a parameter:
        Done through a policy
    Log why a release should be kept:
        Use ILogger to log the actions taken when invoking a policy
        Also record in a metadata object to be used for Interceptors

Library Requirements/Recommendations:

    Policies should use a builder delegate instead of having to be instantiated directly.
    ReleaseRetention could be a simple input/output object instead of using Source and Handlers.

    Hierarchical policies:
        Based on Teamcity and the Octopus Deploy Retention information more specific should override general
        In the case Project < Environment < Base Rules

    Keep only:
        Based on previous library and to reduce complexity will only do keep only rules for the time being

    Interceptors/Hooks:
        Allow for injected extra functionality

    Logging:
        All class should inject ILogger to allow debugging
        Pass a Logger through the context


Octopus deploy policy design:

* One important thing to note about the release retention policy is that any releases displayed on either the main dashboard or a project dashboard are never deleted.

Based on the following only logging is required for why something is kept.
